> **Constraint-Driven Small Language Models Based on Agent and OpenAlex Knowledge Graph: Mining Conceptual Pathways and Discovering Innovation Points in Academic Papers**  
> Ziye Xia, Sergei S. Ospichev (2025)

This repository implements a **four-stage agent framework** that combines **small language models (SLMs)** with the **OpenAlex knowledge graph** to extract structured **concept paths** from academic paper abstracts and identify **scientific innovation points**.

Our approach demonstrates that **rare structural combinations of mainstream concepts**â€”not just novel termsâ€”are the primary source of academic novelty. By enforcing knowledge graph constraints, we achieve **97.24% precision** in end-to-end concept path extraction while mitigating LLM hallucination.
